# AuraTrader: Algorithmic FX Signal Generation and Backtesting Framework

AuraTrader is a Python-based algorithmic trading platform designed for generating high-quality Forex (FX) trading signals using Kalman filter-based state-space models. It provides a comprehensive backtesting framework integrated with broker API latency analysis, allowing traders to evaluate the performance of trading strategies with realistic execution conditions. AuraTrader aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and practical deployment by incorporating real-world constraints like API latency and transaction costs into the backtesting process.

The core of AuraTrader lies in its Kalman filter implementation, which leverages historical price data and potentially other financial indicators to estimate the underlying state of the FX market. These state estimates are then used to generate trading signals, indicating potential buy or sell opportunities. The framework allows for customization of the state-space model, enabling users to experiment with different model parameters and input features to optimize signal generation for specific currency pairs and market conditions. Beyond signal generation, AuraTrader provides a robust backtesting environment where these signals can be tested against historical data, providing insights into the potential profitability and risk profile of the strategy.

The backtesting framework is designed to be highly configurable, allowing users to specify various parameters such as slippage, commission fees, and order types. Crucially, it incorporates broker API latency analysis, simulating the delays inherent in real-world trading environments. This feature allows traders to more accurately assess the feasibility and performance of their strategies by accounting for the impact of latency on order execution. By providing a realistic simulation of trading conditions, AuraTrader helps traders avoid the pitfalls of over-optimistic backtesting results and make more informed decisions about deploying their strategies in live trading environments.

AuraTrader also facilitates integration with broker APIs, allowing for automated order execution based on the generated signals. This feature enables the platform to be used for both research and development of trading strategies as well as for automated trading in live markets. The modular design of the platform allows for easy integration with different broker APIs, providing flexibility for users to choose the broker that best suits their needs. With its focus on realistic backtesting and seamless integration with live trading environments, AuraTrader provides a powerful tool for algorithmic FX traders looking to develop and deploy profitable trading strategies.

**Key Features**

*   **Kalman Filter-Based Signal Generation:** Implements a state-space model with a Kalman filter to estimate the underlying state of the FX market and generate trading signals. Users can customize the model parameters and input features to optimize signal generation. Technical details include the implementation of the prediction and update steps of the Kalman filter, with options for different measurement and process noise covariance matrices.

*   **Comprehensive Backtesting Framework:** Provides a robust backtesting environment with customizable parameters such as slippage, commission fees, and order types. Includes support for various order types (market, limit, stop-loss) and position sizing strategies.

*   **Broker API Latency Analysis:** Integrates broker API latency analysis into the backtesting process, simulating the delays inherent in real-world trading environments. This allows traders to more accurately assess the feasibility and performance of their strategies. Latency is modeled using statistical distributions derived from historical API response times.

*   **Modular Broker API Integration:** Facilitates integration with different broker APIs, allowing for automated order execution based on the generated signals. Supports multiple broker APIs through a plug-in architecture, allowing for easy addition of new brokers.

*   **Customizable Risk Management:** Allows users to define custom risk management rules, such as maximum position size, stop-loss levels, and take-profit targets.

*   **Performance Reporting and Analytics:** Generates detailed performance reports and analytics, including profit/loss statements, drawdown analysis, and Sharpe ratio calculations. Provides visualizations of backtesting results and signal performance.

*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Uses an event-driven architecture for efficient processing of market data and execution of trading orders. This allows for handling high-frequency data and managing multiple trading strategies concurrently.

**Technology Stack**

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the entire platform.
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical computation and data manipulation, especially for Kalman filter calculations.
*   **Pandas:** Used for data analysis and time series management, particularly for backtesting and data preprocessing.
*   **SciPy:** Used for statistical analysis and optimization, supporting the Kalman filter implementation.
*   **Requests:** Used for interacting with broker APIs and retrieving market data.
*   **Matplotlib/Seaborn:** Used for data visualization and generating performance reports.

**Installation**

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/AuraTrader.git

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd AuraTrader

3.  Create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv

4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS)
    venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)

5.  Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

**Configuration**

1.  Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

2.  Define the following environment variables:
    BROKER_API_KEY=your_broker_api_key
    BROKER_API_SECRET=your_broker_api_secret
    BROKER_API_URL=your_broker_api_url
    DATA_SOURCE=your_data_source (e.g., 'Alpha Vantage', 'Quandl')
    DATA_API_KEY=your_data_api_key

3.  Configure the `config.py` file to specify trading parameters, such as currency pair, initial capital, and risk management settings. This file contains Python dictionaries defining various parameters; modify these dictionaries to tailor the framework to your specific trading strategy and risk tolerance.

**Usage**

1.  Data Ingestion: Use the data ingestion module to download historical FX data from your chosen data source. For example:
    python data_ingestion.py --currency_pair EURUSD --start_date 2023-01-01 --end_date 2023-12-31

2.  Signal Generation: Use the Kalman filter-based signal generation module to generate trading signals based on the ingested data. The main function `generate_signals` in `signal_generation.py` takes historical data and model parameters as input and returns a list of trading signals.
    python signal_generation.py --currency_pair EURUSD --model_parameters config.json

3.  Backtesting: Use the backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the generated signals. The `backtest` function in `backtesting.py` simulates trading based on the generated signals and returns performance metrics such as profit/loss, drawdown, and Sharpe ratio.
    python backtesting.py --currency_pair EURUSD --signals signals.csv --initial_capital 10000

4.  Automated Trading: Integrate the platform with your broker API to automate order execution. Use the broker API integration module to connect to your broker and execute trades based on the generated signals. This involves implementing the `execute_order` function in the `broker_integration.py` module to handle order placement and management.
