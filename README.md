# AuraTrader: Algorithmic Trading Platform for Enhanced Market Analysis

AuraTrader is a Python-based algorithmic trading platform designed to empower traders with advanced tools for market analysis, automated trading strategies, and portfolio management. This platform allows users to define and execute complex trading algorithms based on real-time market data, historical data analysis, and various technical indicators. AuraTrader aims to provide a flexible and robust environment for both novice and experienced traders to optimize their trading strategies and improve their overall portfolio performance.

AuraTrader distinguishes itself by offering a modular architecture that facilitates the integration of various data sources, trading brokers, and custom trading strategies. The core of the platform revolves around a sophisticated event-driven system that efficiently manages real-time market data and triggers trading signals based on pre-defined rules. The platform also incorporates advanced risk management features, including stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, and portfolio diversification strategies, to mitigate potential losses and safeguard investments. Further enhancing its utility, AuraTrader provides comprehensive backtesting capabilities, allowing users to evaluate the performance of their trading algorithms on historical data before deploying them in live trading environments.

Beyond its core trading functionalities, AuraTrader emphasizes user-friendliness through a well-documented API and a comprehensive set of example trading strategies. The platform supports multiple asset classes, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and foreign exchange, allowing users to diversify their trading portfolios. Furthermore, AuraTrader's modular design ensures that it can be easily extended and customized to meet the specific needs of individual traders. The platform's focus on performance optimization, scalability, and security makes it a reliable and effective tool for both individual traders and institutional investors seeking to leverage the power of algorithmic trading.

### Key Features

*   **Real-time Market Data Integration:** Connects to multiple market data providers (e.g., Alpaca, IEX Cloud) using asynchronous APIs to provide low-latency access to streaming price data. This is achieved through the use of the `asyncio` library and specialized data connector classes.
*   **Customizable Trading Strategies:** Enables users to define their own trading algorithms using Python. These strategies can be based on a variety of technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI, MACD) and fundamental data. Strategy backtesting and optimization are supported using the `backtrader` library, allowing for iterative improvement of algorithms.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** Employs an event-driven architecture to efficiently process market data and trigger trading signals. This architecture ensures that the platform can handle high volumes of data with minimal latency. The `asyncio` library is extensively used to manage asynchronous events and callbacks.
*   **Portfolio Management:** Provides tools for managing trading portfolios, including position tracking, risk management, and performance reporting. The platform calculates key performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and total return. Portfolio diversification strategies can be implemented through the configuration file.
*   **Risk Management:** Incorporates risk management features, such as stop-loss orders, take-profit orders, and position sizing, to mitigate potential losses. The platform dynamically adjusts position sizes based on market volatility and user-defined risk tolerance levels.
*   **Backtesting:** Allows users to backtest their trading algorithms on historical data to evaluate their performance before deploying them in live trading environments. The `backtrader` library provides a comprehensive backtesting framework, enabling users to simulate trading scenarios and optimize their strategies.
*   **Brokerage Integration:** Connects to multiple brokerage accounts (e.g., Alpaca, Interactive Brokers) using API keys. The platform supports automated order execution, allowing users to seamlessly implement their trading strategies in live trading environments.

### Technology Stack

*   **Python:** The core programming language for the platform, providing a flexible and powerful environment for developing trading algorithms.
*   **asyncio:** A library for writing concurrent code using the async/await syntax, enabling efficient handling of real-time market data and asynchronous API calls.
*   **backtrader:** A Python framework for backtesting trading strategies, providing tools for simulating trading scenarios and evaluating algorithm performance.
*   **Alpaca API (or other brokerage API):** Enables connectivity to brokerage accounts for automated order execution. (Note: the specific API used will depend on the brokerage chosen.)
*   **Pandas:** A data analysis library used for processing and analyzing market data.
*   **NumPy:** A library for numerical computing, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/AuraTrader.git
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    cd AuraTrader
3.  Create a virtual environment:
    python3 -m venv venv
4.  Activate the virtual environment:
    source venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS)
    venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
5.  Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Configuration

The platform requires several environment variables to be configured. These variables are used to connect to market data providers, brokerage accounts, and other external services.

*   `ALPACA_API_KEY`: Your Alpaca API key.
*   `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`: Your Alpaca secret key.
*   `IEX_CLOUD_API_TOKEN`: Your IEX Cloud API token (if using IEX Cloud for market data).

These environment variables can be set using the `export` command (Linux/macOS) or the `set` command (Windows). Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file in the project directory and load the variables using a library such as `python-dotenv`.

Example `.env` file:
ALPACA_API_KEY=YOUR_ALPACA_API_KEY
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_ALPACA_SECRET_KEY
IEX_CLOUD_API_TOKEN=YOUR_IEX_CLOUD_API_TOKEN

### Usage

To run a trading strategy, you first need to define a strategy class that inherits from the base `Strategy` class. This class should implement the `next()` method, which is called on each incoming market data update.

Example trading strategy:

class MyStrategy(Strategy):
    def __init__(self):
        self.sma = bt.indicators.SimpleMovingAverage(self.data.close, period=20)

    def next(self):
        if self.data.close[0] > self.sma[0]:
            self.buy()
        elif self.data.close[0] < self.sma[0]:
            self.sell()

To run the strategy, you need to create a `Cerebro` instance and add the strategy, data feed, and broker.

cerebro = bt.Cerebro()
cerebro.addstrategy(MyStrategy)
data = bt.feeds.YahooFinanceCSVData(dataname='AAPL.csv')
cerebro.adddata(data)
cerebro.broker.setcash(100000.0)
cerebro.run()
